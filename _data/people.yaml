    James Doss-Gollin is an assistant professor in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University. Dr. Doss-Gollin's research is motivated by challenging questions at the intersection of climate dynamics, water management, data science, and decision science. By developing methods for understanding and predicting spatiotemporally clustered hydroclimate risk, and for incorporating uncertain projections into sequential decision problems, he strives to enable the delivery of adaptive and resilient infrastructure services. Dr. Doss-Gollin completed his Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia and holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Yale University. Prior to joining Rice University, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at the Pennsylvania State University.

    Alyssa Graham is a Masters of Science student in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University. She is primarily interested in the application of circular economy methods to resource and supply chains in order to improve community resilience and inform policy for environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Her current research focuses on improving urban water infrastructure resilience through water re-use and circular economy principles. She received her B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Rice University in 2020.
