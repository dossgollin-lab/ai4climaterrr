  apply: Email James a 1-2 page research statement describing the project you would like to carry out.

- role: Graduate students
  status: There are funded positions for graduate students available.

- role: Postdoctoral Researchers
  status: We are not actively recruiting a postdoc, but anticipate recruiting in the near to medium future.
  apply: "If you're interested, please email a CV and 2-3 page research statement to James. Strong candidates will have strengths in several (but not all) of: Bayesian modeling; spatiotemporal statistics; computer vision; precipitation physics; Julia/Python/C programming; nonlinear dynamics. If you're not sure whether this describes you, email James -- studies show that researchers from historically excluded groups systematically underestimate their abilities."
