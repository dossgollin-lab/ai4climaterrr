### Postdocs

We are not actively recruiting a postdoc, but anticipate recruiting in the medium future.

#### How to apply

If you're interested, please email a CV and 2-3 page research statement to James.

Strong candidates will have strengths in several (but not all) of the following:
Bayesian modeling; spatiotemporal statistics; computer vision; surrogate modeling; fluid dynamics; precipitation physics; Julia/Python/C programming; or nonlinear dynamics.

If you're not sure whether this describes you, email James -- be aware that studies show that researchers from historically excluded groups systematically underestimate their abilities, so please don't undersell yourself!
