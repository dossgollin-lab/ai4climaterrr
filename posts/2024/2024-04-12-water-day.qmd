To celebrate World Water Day 2024 and the kickoff of a new water institute at ASU, we were asked to create a five minute video on a local water challenge.
While Houston has important challenges related to droughts, infrastructure financing, and water infrastructure, we created a video titled "how to equitably and sustinably manage intensifying rainfall in fast-changing cities?"
