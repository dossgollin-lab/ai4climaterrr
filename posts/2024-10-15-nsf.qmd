Rice University recently highlighted a new research award for our cluster.

The $1.5M NSF-funded project, led by cluster co-PI Jamie Padgett and including co-PI Avantika Gori, will develop OpenSafe.AI - an intelligent system that combines responsible AI with hazard modeling to provide real-time situational awareness during severe coastal storms.
The framework aims to support emergency responders and communities with equitable, data-driven insights for disaster preparation and response.
