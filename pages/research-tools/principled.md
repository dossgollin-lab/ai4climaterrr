The success of an infrastructure project depends on future climate, 

Many of the variables we work on are deeply uncertain.

Managing climate risk requires modeling environmental variables at a range of spatial and temporal scales.
In order to be useful for decision making, models should:

* agree with a hierarchy of simple, intermediate, and complex models
* allow computationally cheap simulation suitable for use in an optimization framework
* credibly represent the spatial correlation structure of the variables of interest
* reproduce the relevant time scales of climate variability, including quasi-cyclical interannual to multidecadal modes
* quantify uncertainty using the tools of probability theory

To address these challenges, we're developing methods for integrating previously published results, simulations from complex models, and physical reasoning into the design and validation of physically informed Bayesian space-time models.
