The Mississippi River drains a continent, gathering water from as far as Pennsylvania and Montana and discharging it into the Gulf of Mexico.
The channeling of so much water into a single river naturally raises the stakes for flooding, and the river has one of the most extensive flood mitigation systems in the world.
However, the performance of this infrastructure under a changing climate remains uncertain.
Previous studies suggest that the net effect of warming on Mississippi River flood risk is determined by a balance between competing effects: warming accelerates evaporation and reduces snowpack, but on the other hand warmer air generally holds more moisture.
This projects seeks to determine the net effect of these competing influences on Mississippi River discharge, which serves as a broad-brush proxy for flood risk, using a combination of weather and streamflow observing networks, paleoclimate reconstructions, and ensembles of present-day and last millennium climate model simulations.
