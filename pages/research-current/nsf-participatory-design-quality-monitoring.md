Aging infrastructure, increasing droughts, groundwater depletion, and contamination of water supplies all challenge America’s drinking water infrastructure.
Water typically is treated at central facilities and then piped to users, but recent technological advances could enable water treatment at the point of use (e.g., a house).
In theory, this approach can make water systems more resilient to extremes, reduce the need for pipes and pumping, help water systems scale up or down as populations change, and filter contaminants that existing plants cannot treat cost-effectively.
However, point of use water treatment also shifts the burden of maintaining water treatment infrastructure, monitoring water quality, and governing water systems onto end users, creating new vulnerabilities for water infrastructure systems.
In this project, we are working with residents of colonias in El Paso County, Texas, to codevelop an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems.
Many residents of these communities lack access to safe drinking water, and efforts to improve water security are hampered by financial constraints, socio-political marginalization of residents, and lack of surface water sources (see [this video](https://www.newsy.com/stories/racing-climate-change-to-get-water-in-rural-texas/)).
