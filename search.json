    "text": "Rice University recently highlighted research from our AI for Climate Risk and Resilience at Rice (AI4CRRR) cluster. The feature story covers work led by cluster co-PI Jamie Padgett, focusing on an AI-driven system for real-time sensing of flooded roads.\nThe featured study introduces OpenSafe Fusion, an automated data fusion framework that leverages existing public data sources to predict road flooding conditions. By combining insights from traffic alerts, cameras, and traffic speed data, the system demonstrated promising results in tests using historical data from Hurricane Harvey. We hope this approach can significantly advance flood situational awareness without requiring substantial investment in new infrastructure, potentially improving public safety and mobility during increasingly frequent urban flooding events.\nFor more details, read the full story or access the research study."

Managing these risks requires predictive understanding of both natural hazards and the response of human systems. While traditional hazard models shed light on many quesitons, they are often subject to sever limitations in resolution, computational efficiency, or geographic transferability.\nOur research cluster integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning with physics-based models to advance understanding of climate risks and enhance infrastructure resilience. We are working to develop open-source, computationally efficient, and high-resolution models to inform the management of complex, interconnected systems facing extreme weather in a changing climate. Key focus areas include:\n\nSynthetic Hazard Generation: Creating large datasets of synthetic weather patterns and employing AI for high-resolution downscaling to urban scales.\nInfrastructure Systems Response: Characterizing hazard impacts on critical systems using AI- and optimization-enhanced approaches.\nMultiscale Earth Observation and Data Assimilation: Leveraging heterogeneous datasets from diverse sources to improve model performance and enable real-time initialization.\nTrustworthiness and Validation: Advancing the transparency and reliability of physics-informed AI methods through rigorous evaluation.\n\nOur initial pilot project focuses on real-time flood forecasting and transportation accessibility in the Houston, TX region.\n\n\n\n\n   \n     \n     \n       Order By\n       Default\n         \n          Date - Oldest\n        \n         \n          Date - Newest\n        \n         \n          Title\n        \n     \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nDate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI4ClimateRRR at AGU 2024\n\n\nDecember 5, 2024\n\n\n\n\nCoverage: Rice-led research will leverage responsible AI to enhance coastal communities’ severe storm response\n\n\nOctober 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\nCoverage: Rice engineers develop AI system for real-time sensing of flooded roads\n\n\nAugust 26, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
