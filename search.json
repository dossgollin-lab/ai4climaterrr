We focus on developing computationally efficient, high-resolution models to inform the management of complex, interconnected systems facing extreme weather in a changing climate.\n\n\nClimate change is intensifying extreme weather events, posing unprecedented risks to urban infrastructure and communities. Traditional models, while valuable, often face limitations in resolution, computational efficiency, or geographic transferability.
