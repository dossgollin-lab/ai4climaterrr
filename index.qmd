# AI for Climate Risk and Resilience at Rice

Our research cluster integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning with physics-based models to advance our understanding of climate risks and enhance infrastructure resilience. We focus on developing computationally efficient, high-resolution models to inform the management of complex, interconnected systems facing extreme weather in a changing climate.

## Research Significance

Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, posing unprecedented risks to urban infrastructure and communities. Traditional models, while valuable, often face limitations in resolution, computational efficiency, or geographic transferability. Our work addresses these challenges by:

- Developing AI-enhanced models that improve speed, resolution, and adaptability
- Spanning scales from regional weather patterns to local infrastructure impacts
- Enhancing accessibility and actionability of climate risk assessments for stakeholders

## Core Research Areas

1. **Synthetic Hazard Generation:** Creating large datasets of synthetic weather patterns (e.g., hurricanes, cold waves) and employing AI for high-resolution downscaling to urban scales.
2. **Infrastructure Systems Response:** Characterizing hazard impacts on critical systems (e.g., road networks, water resources) using AI- and optimization-enhanced approaches.
3. **Multiscale Earth Observation and Data Assimilation:** Leveraging heterogeneous datasets from diverse sources (e.g., traffic cameras, satellite products) to improve model performance and enable real-time initialization.
4. **Trustworthiness and Validation:** Advancing the transparency and reliability of physics-informed AI methods through rigorous evaluation of their ability to capture relevant dynamics and outcomes.

## Current Focus: Urban Resilience in Houston

Our initial project addresses road network flooding from tropical cyclones in Houston, Texas.
This project serves as a foundation for developing approaches applicable to diverse urban environments and climate-related challenges.

## Open Science

We are dedicated to advancing climate resilience through collaborative efforts:

- Developing open-source software and tools
- Ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our methodologies
- Disseminating findings to both academic and public spheres
