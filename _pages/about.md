I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia Engineering and a researcher at the Columbia Water Center.
I'll be a postdoc with the [Keller Group](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/){:target="_blank"} at Penn State starting July 2020, and an assistant professor in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Rice University starting January 2021.
I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Yale University and my M.S. from Columbia University.

I have broad interests in climate dynamics, water management, natural hazards, decision science, and risk management and am motivated by challenging questions at the intersection of these fields.
My PhD work develops methods for understanding and predicting spatiotemporally clustered hydroclimate risk, and for incorporating uncertain projections into sequential decision problems.
In particular, it focuses on understanding and predicting low-frequency climate variability, and on understanding how adaptive planning techniques could leverage skillful forecasts.

If I'm not in the office, you can probably find me watching [La Albirroja](https://twitter.com/albirroja?lang=en){:target="_blank"}, [A.S. Roma](https://www.chiesaditotti.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Sportivo Luque√±o](http://clubsportivoluqueno.com.py/){:target="_blank"} or explaining why New Haven [apizza](https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/An-upcoming-film-celebrates-New-Haven-s-holy-12576171.php){:target="_blank"} is the truth.
