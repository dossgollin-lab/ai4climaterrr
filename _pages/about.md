I'm a postdoc with the [Keller Group](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/){:target="_blank"} at the Penn State [Earth and Environmental Systems Institute](https://www.eesi.psu.edu/people){:target="_blank"}.
My work is motivated by challenging questions at the intersection of climate dynamics, water management, data science, and decision science.

I completed my Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Engineering at the [Columbia Water Center](https://water.columbia.edu){:target="_blank"} and hold a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Yale University.
My Ph.D. dissertation, advised by [Upmanu Lall](http://www.columbia.edu/~ula2/){:target="_blank"}, develops methods for understanding and predicting spatiotemporally clustered hydroclimate risk, and for incorporating uncertain projections into sequential decision problems.
In January 2021 I will join the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Rice University as an assistant professor.

If I'm not in the office, you can probably find me watching [La Albirroja](https://twitter.com/albirroja?lang=en){:target="_blank"}, [A.S. Roma](https://www.chiesaditotti.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Sportivo Luque√±o](http://clubsportivoluqueno.com.py/){:target="_blank"} or explaining why New Haven [apizza](https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/An-upcoming-film-celebrates-New-Haven-s-holy-12576171.php){:target="_blank"} is the truth.
