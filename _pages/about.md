I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia Engineering and a researcher at the Columbia Water Center. 
I have broad interests in climate dynamics, water management, natural hazards, decision science, and risk management and am motivated by challenging questions at the intersection of these fields.
My dissertation develops methods for understanding and predicting spatiotemporally clustered hydroclimate risk, and for incorporating uncertain projections into sequential decision problems.
I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Yale University and my M.S. from Columbia University.
I was awarded a presidential fellowship from Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science and a graduate research fellowship in climate and large-scale dynamics from the National Science Foundation.

If I'm not in the office, you can probably find me watching [La Albirroja](https://twitter.com/albirroja?lang=en){:target="_blank"}, [A.S. Roma](https://www.chiesaditotti.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Sportivo Luqueño](http://clubsportivoluqueno.com.py/){:target="_blank"}, or explaining why New Haven [apizza](https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/An-upcoming-film-celebrates-New-Haven-s-holy-12576171.php){:target="_blank"} is the truth.

## Why I Do It

Growing up in the United States, I never thought much about having access to sufficient quantities of clean and safe drinking water.
So when the [Fundación Paraguaya](http://www.fundacionparaguaya.org.py/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} gave me the opportunity to work with them on a water access project in rural Paraguay, I assumed that the technical challenges would be within my grasp.
Although I found I could understand calculations such as sizing pipes and motors or dosing chlorine, so could the people who operated and depended on the small systems!
Instead, three months traveling around the country highlighted the resilience and ingenuity of ordinary people, but also the vulnerability that their communities face to external shocks such as prolonged drought, aquifer contamination, and economic collapse.
Other experiences in the US, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Brazil deepened this interest.

I work to develop quantitative and data-intensive tools so that I can better examine human-environment systems, probe where catastrophic events could happen, and look for solutions that reduce those risks.
Research is always incremental, and I know that making even a dent in the huge collective challenges we face will require collaboration and luck, but if you're interested in these ideas I'd love to talk further!
