I gave a short talk at the [2019 Doctoral Consortium on Computational Sustainability](http://www.compsust.net/compsust-2019/).
I presented a paper I'm finishing that touches on the management of complex adaptive systems, real and financial options, reinforcement learning, and more.
I jettisoned all advice about how to fit a presentation into 15 minutes (make just one point, talk slowly) but I don't think it mattered as my talk followed a fascinating presentation by [Zico Kolter](http://zicokolter.com/).
