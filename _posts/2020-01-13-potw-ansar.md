> My resolution for the new year was to write regularly about a paper I've read.
I will try to publish these posts, which are compiled [here]({{site.baseurl}}/tag/potw/){:target="_blank"}, on a roughly biweekly schedule.
I've also added commenting using [`gitalk`](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk){:target="_blank"} (which uses GitHub Issues as a backend, greatly boosting speed and privacy relative to other technologies like Disqus) and hope that these posts can spark a deeper conversation on and off this blog.

This week's post {% cite ansar_china:2016 %} questions the narrative that more infrastructure spending is almost always better, and more specifically that economies of scale generally make larger and more centrally planned infrastructure relatively more attractive.
The authors point out that the theory of "bigger is better" has had a wide impact on a wide range of industries, and has also influenced thinking around infrastructure systems -- as evident on, for example, the projects advocated by the American Society of Civil Engineering's [Infrastructure Report Card](https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/){:target="_blank"}.
The crux of their argument is outlined in the quotation below:

> We do not refute the existence of economies of scale and scope. Instead we argue that big capital investments have a disproportionate (non- linear) exposure to uncertainties that deliver poor or negative returns above and beyond their economies of scale and scope. We further argue that to succeed, leaders of capital projects need to carefully consider where scaling pays off and where it does not. To automatically assume that "bigger is better," which is common in megaproject management, is a recipe for failure.


The argument that bigger and more centralized infrastructure systems are not always better follows other papers by the same authors {% cite ansar_megadams:2014 ansar_china:2016 %} and a thread of thinking that has emerged more braodly in the literature and has had a strong influence on my own thinking.
For example, Nassim Taleb argues that big and centralized systems are "fragile", or prone to failure, because  {% cite taleb_antifragile:2012 %}.

The key shortcoming of this paper is that the authors define fragility as any investment that doesn't meet pre-specified goals.
While assessing such projects is a useful and valuable goal, it's a bit different from the fragility that Taleb describes because it doesn't (necessarily) lead to catastrophic failure of the system.
Indeed, a central argument that Taleb makes is that it is the "fat tails" of risk that matter, and fragility is best conceptualized as asking whether the distribution of possible outcomes has fat tails on the right side (an "antifragile" system benefits from randomness) or the left side (a "fragile" system is destroyed by randomness).
Thus the link between Taleb's work on fragility and Ansar's work on evaluating the financial outcomes of infrastructure projects is somewhat tenuous.
