The General Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is commonly used in hydrological analysis.
But is it always the right choice?

In a blog post which you can read [here](https://jamesdossgollin.me/blog/gev-marginal.html){:target="_blank"} I run some simple simulations to explore a scenario where the GEV can *appear* to be the right distribution, even when it's not.
This can lead to under-preparedness for future climate.
