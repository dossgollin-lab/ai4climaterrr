According to [Floodlist](http://floodlist.com/america/paraguay-asuncion-river-floods-october-2018){:target="_blank"}, over 10000 people in Asunci√≥n and other parts of Paraguay have had to leave their homes due to severe flooding on the Lower Paraguay River.
What's causing this?

Since coauthors and I recently wrote a paper in Journal of Climate on the drivers of other floods in this region {% cite DossGollin:2018bn %}, I prepared a brief exploration of the recent event to see whether a similar set of mechanisms was at play in the recent flood events.
