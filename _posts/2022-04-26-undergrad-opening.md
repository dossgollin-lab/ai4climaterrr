There are open positions for one or more undergraduate research assistants to work on an NSF-funded research project starting Fall 2022.
This project is part of a collaboration with political science and engineering researchers at TAMU, UTEP, and George Washington University to understand pathways to resilient water supply in colonias, which are under-served and historically marginalized communities near El Paso.
Specifically, this project seeks to identify strategies for ensuring that decentralized water treatment technologies, which , actually contribute to water security.
You can read more about the project [here](/funded-projects) (scroll to *Participatory Design for Water Quality Monitoring of Highly Decentralized Water Infrastructure Systems*).

Normally undergraduates are encouraged to conduct research for credit before working for pay, but there is some flexibility for this project.

### Responsibilities

* Attend regular lab and project meetings (~1 hour per week)
* Independently research possible water supply solutions that are appropriate for Texas colonias
* Contribute to water supply vulnerability assessments

### Required qualifications

* Openness to multi-semester collaboration
* Positive attitude to constructive feedback
* Ability to work independently and self-motivate
* Knowledge of drinking water supply systems and treatment technologies (e.g., CEVE 315/316)

### Preferred qualifications

* Demonstrated interest in water supply systems (e.g., EWB)
* Proficiency (good) or fluency (great) in Spanish
* Prior research or independent study experience
* Proficiency with Zotero

### How to apply

See the lab guide at [instructions for undergraduates](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/lab-guide/policies/undergrad/) page.
