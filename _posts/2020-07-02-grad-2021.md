There are funded positions for Ph.D. students starting in 2021.
Strong candidates are passionate about infrastructure and climate, have strong quantitative and critical thinking skills, are curious to explore new ideas, perspectives, and methods, and can clearly articulate their research goals.
Broad research themes focus on designing infrastructure plans that use nonstructural instruments (such as insurance, nature-based solutions, early warning systems, and household-scale adaptation) to improve near-term system performance while increasing the system's capacity to adapt to deeply uncertain long-term changes.
Funding is not tied to a particular project but applicants should articulate interest in [mission-oriented basic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur%27s_quadrant){:target="_blank"} that advances these broad themes through generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, and adaptive decision making.

### Minimum qualifications

* Commitment to our [mission and values]({{ site.labguide }}){:target="_blank"}
* Coursework in calculus and statistics
* Interest in flood risk management, urban water systems, coastal resilience, renewable energy, or a related application
* Strong quantitative skills

        No applicant is expected to have <strong>all</strong> of these characteristics.
        Ph.D. students are just that -- students -- and we will teach you what you need to know.

* Ability to code in at least one programming language (Julia or Python preferred)
* Coursework in any of: Bayesian modeling, machine learning, water systems analysis, electricity systems, hydrology, climate dynamics, reinforcement learning, optimization, software engineering, economics, or similar
* [Perseverance, tenacity, and cogency](http://matt.might.net/articles/successful-phd-students/)
* Strong written and verbal communication skills
* Firsthand experience collaborating with stakeholders to design, build, or critique infrastructure systems

### Why Rice CEE

There are many fantastic graduate programs for smart and motivated students!
All of them will expose you to brilliant faculty, professional development opportunities, and rigorous courses.
However, allow a brief sales pitch:

* Houston is [a great place to live](https://engineering.rice.edu/about/living-houston). Compared to other large cities in the US, Houston is relatively affordable and offers a high standard of living. Houston is also sunny, diverse, and host to a great international food scene. Rice's campus is stunningly beautiful.
* Campus culture at Rice in general, and in CEE in particular, is friendly and collaborative.
* The region is a living urban laboratory for issues including flooding, drought, urban water systems, and renewable energy.
(_As detailed in our [lab guide]({{ site.labguide }}){:target="_blank"} it is important to approach case studies with humility and deep respect for our partners_).

### How to apply

As explained [here](/join-the-lab), you must apply to the program of your choice in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/graduate-program/).
You are strongly encouraged (though not formally required) to send James an [email](/contact) with your current CV, a statement of your personal and research interests, and any relevant experience before submitting your departmental application.

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering requires the Graduate Records Exam (GRE) as part of a holistic application review.
However, since research indicates that the GRE primarily identifies race and socio-economic status, and its usefullness to predict research ability is limited at best, I will not consider GRE scores when evaluating which applicants I will ask the department to admit.
If the GRE requirement or application fee poses a burden you, please [reach out](/contact).
