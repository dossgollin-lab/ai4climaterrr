excerpt: After graduating, I'll spend six months with the Keller group at PSU then start an assistant professor position at Rice
---

As you may know, I've been at the [Columbia Water Center](https://water.columbia.edu){:target="_blank"} since September 2015 pursuing a Ph.D. in [Earth and Environmental Engineering](https://eee.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
I've had the chance to interact with many wonderful classmates, colleagues, teachers, and mentors, and have learned more in five years than I ever thought possible.
I've spent a lot of time (far too much...) over the past six months thinking about what will come after I complete my degree, and finally have some concrete news to share.

In January 2021 I will start as an assistant professor at [Rice University](https://rice.edu/){:target="_blank"} in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
I'm very excited to join this brilliant and diverse department; in the time I've shared with them, I've found everyone to be kind, welcoming, and supportive.
There my research group will develop tools and knowledge to help decision-makers plan and design infrastructure systems under uncertainty, with a particular focus on flood resilience, water systems management, and renewable energy.
Texas and Houston offer exciting contexts within which to explore these questions, and I'm particularly excited to join ongoing projects around flood resilience at the [SSPEED Center](https://www.sspeed.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [CERISE Center](https://www.cerise.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"}, though I plan to work in other contexts too.

Houston is far from home, and Mari and I are of course a bit nervous at the prospect of being so far from our friends and family.
However, Houston is a vibrant, diverse, and growing city, and we're excited to spend the next stage of our lives there.
Come visit!

Between now and January 2021, I aim to defend my dissertation (hopefully in April/May 2020) and then spend six months with the [Keller Group](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/){:target="_blank"} at the Pennsylvania State University.
I'll continue my work on flood adaptation under uncertainty and expect to learn a lot from the wonderful team there.

After a long period of uncertainty, it feels great to have finalized these plans.
I'm very excited about all that lies ahead, and even more grateful for the opportunities -- most of them undeserved -- that have smoothed my path.
Thanks to all my mentors, teachers, friends, colleagues, and family for your incredible support!
