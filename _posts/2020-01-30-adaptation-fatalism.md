My editorial with David J. Farnham, Michelle Ho, and and Upmanu Lall has been published in the ASCE Journal of Water Resources Management and Planning {% cite doss-gollin_fatalism:2020 %}.

This paper describes how we can more effectively manage climate risks in a fast-changing world and how scientists and engineers can contribute to productive, rather than fatalistic, narratives.
As always, if you don't have access to the paper but would like to read it, please [contact me](/contact).
