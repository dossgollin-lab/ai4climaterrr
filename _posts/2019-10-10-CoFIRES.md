I gave a short talk at the annual strategic retreat of the [Center on Financial Risk in Environmental Systems](https://sph.unc.edu/cfres/center-on-financial-risk-in-environmental-systems/) at UNC Chapen Hill.
The nominal topic of my talk is uncertainty and flood loss estimates, but it evolved largely into a rant about the importance of considering low-frequency variability when thinking about flood risk.

Thanks to Greg Characklis for the invitation, and to his students and colleagues for a great workshop.
