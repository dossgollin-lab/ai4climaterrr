If you've been following the news this week, you probably heard about the proposed Green New Deal:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/AOC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AOC</a> on Green New Deal: &quot;Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us to our country, to the world.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/H0qKijUcKL">https://t.co/H0qKijUcKL</a></p>&mdash; Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) <a href="https://twitter.com/GideonResnick/status/1093507478409695232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

It's exciting that climate and energy policy are back in the news!
It's great to have leaders staking out ambitious ideas.
But as a pure policy proposal, the current iteration of the Green New Deal is neglecting some of the most important levers available to us.
That's OK -- it's meant to be a rough draft!
