II gave a talk in the session H11G - Water and Society: Adaptive Management for Floods and Droughts in the Face of Global Climate and Socioeconomic Change I.
My talk (which differs substantially from the [abstract](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/619257)) tries to define adaptive resilience through some conceptual framing and exploration of simple models.
You can find my slides [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11397936.v1).
