I'll be giving a talk tomorrow morning (well, this morning now) in the session H11G - Water and Society: Adaptive Management for Floods and Droughts in the Face of Global Climate and Socioeconomic Change I.
My talk (which differs substantially from the [abstract](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/619257)) tries to define adaptive resilience through some conceptual framing and exploration of simple models.
You can find my slides [here](assets/pdf/2019-12-09-agu-slides.pdf).
